        <h1>Reflections on Learning Cantonese</h1>
        <p>
            <i class="material-icons">forum</i> 
            Neither of my parents are Cantonese. My father is Teochew and my mother is Hokkien.
            But because they are of different dialects, despite the similarities in Teochew and
            Hokkien it is not the language they choose to speak in, which is Cantonese. Hence I
            grew up listening to my parents speak Cantonese to each other my entire life, and for 
            the most part I can understand about 90% of what they say day to day.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that doesn't mean I got to learn this dialect. My mom does not believe it is
            important to learn dialects, so our parents normally have all conversations 
            with me and my sister in English. I've also always been afraid to challenge my mom's 
            authority to speak Cantonese more as well. And though I am also interested in Hokkien/
            Teochew, there are even less opportunities for me to pick it up from home as spoken 
            Hokkien and Teochew are not mutually intelligible.
        </p>

        <p>
            So naturally when I was told that somebody was organizing a DYOM to learn spoken 
            Cantonese, I was keen to take it in order to get a chance (and a reason) to start 
            speaking Cantonese at home. Though my standard is still nowhere near I'd have liked it
            to be, it is still a marked improvement. After conducting the interview with my Dad it
            also seems that he is keen to continue to talk to me in Cantonese.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the most important things I have learnt are the aspect particles used. Because
            I have never formally studied Cantonese, I only picked up a few particles such as 咗 (zo2)
            for perfect tense, 吓 (haa5) for short durations before and the ubiquitous 呀 (aa3). 
            But I have learnt new ones since. There are aspect particles such as 緊 (gan2) for progressives, 
            落去 (lok6heoi3) for the continuation of something and the sentence final particle 嘅 (ge3).
        </p>

        <p>
            However a major problem I am still struggling with is the vocabulary. Though I am able to 
            understand most (basic to intermediate) spoken Cantonese sentences, the reverse process of 
            matching the word is the most time consuming part of sentence formation for me. I have not 
            formally learnt languages other than English and Chinese in my life so I am not used to this 
            process. Often there is a process of coming up with the Chinese equivalent and then trying to
            translate that to Cantonese which given enough time I am able to, but in the short period of 
            time allowed by conversation it is a challenging task. I still have difficulties coming up with 
            the correct word for want in the correct context, such as 要(yiu3) vs 爱(oi1), and the correct word 
            in the correct context for like from informal like 爱(oi1) or 锺意(zhung1yi3) to formal like 
            喜欢(heei2fun1). 
        </p>

        <p>
            One more interesting thing i picked up on is how regional differences In particular it is 
            interesting to me how regional differences are very prominent even across the same language.
            I used to have even more difficulty understanding cantonese songs sung by Hong Kong singers
            from the 80s and 90s (even though I know the tune by heart because I've heard it so many times
            from my parents' radio then). The key reason was because of how Hong Kong speakers
            use a version more similar to Mandarin in terms of vocabulary, whereas the dialect spoken
            in Malaysia has more colloquial terms such as 馬打(ma3ta1) for 警察(ging2cat4), or 箍(kau1)
            instead of 蚊(man1) for dollar.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope that I can continue to find opportunities and overcome any inhibitions to continue to use
            Cantonese day to day.
